### Aim

This project aims to build a barter application for second-hand vehicle that the history of vehicles will be transparent and shared. No severe frauds will be conducted, and users can browse the second-hand vehicle information on the application and assess its value before engaging in a barter-based exchange of vehicles. In order to achieve this, the project will be divided into two parts, one part is to find a way to store vehicleâ€™s history securely and transparently, and the other part is to build a trading platform that users can barter vehicles.
