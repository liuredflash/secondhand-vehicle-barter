1. gas optimization  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&t=98808s
    immutable and constant  // cost gas when deployed and called
    memory, storage, calldata
    use custome error but require()
    try to reduce the number of access of storage variables, create a memory variable instead, especially in a loop

2. receive and fallback
    receive when no msg.data but with value
    if receive not declared, will call fallback

    fallback when with msg.data and value but no such function   

3. object(bytecodes) and opcodes
    you can calculate how much gas you will spend by using opcodes, every action costs a certain amount of gas
